TaskApp
=======

This a TODO list made with Kivy. This program focuses on a clean and easy access to creating simple visual tasks. It has a screen that shows the five last added tasks, another that will show all open tasks, and another that shows all tasks that have been completed. It also has a fullscreen view where you only need to click on the task and the task will occupy the entire screen. 

This app was tested in windows 8.1 with Kivy Portable and in an Android Galaxy Note 2 using Kivy Launcher.


Enjoy the App!
