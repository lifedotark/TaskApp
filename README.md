TaskApp
=======

This a TODO list made with Kivy. This program focuses on a clean and easy access to creating simple visual tasks. It has a screen that shows the five latest screens added, another that shows all open tasks, and another that shows all tasks that have been completed. It also has a fullscreen view where you only need to click on the task and the task will occupy the entire screen.

Enjoy!
